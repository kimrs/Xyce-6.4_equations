If you are inside Sandia, you can check out the test suite directly from our CVS repository.
  -  Checkout the test suite (cvs -d :ext:joseki:/Net/Proj/Xyce/CVS checkout Xyce_Regression)
  - If on the SRN and desiring the full test suite to include radiation models,
    check out the export controlled test cases, too:
    cd Xyce_Regression
    cvs -d :ext:charleston:/Net/Proj/Xyce/CVS checkout Xyce_SandiaRegression

If you are external to Sandia, you can obtain the test suite from the download area of our
external web site at http://xyce.sandia.gov/.  Only the non-export controlled test cases are
available outside of the labs.

The procedure for running the test suite is described in the
Documentation and Tutorials section of the Xyce web site at
http://xyce.sandia.gov/ under "Running the Xyce Regression Suite."
